### 🚀 Setup Instructions

1. **Install** XAMPP (or MAMP) on your computer.
2. **Clone the repository** directly into your XAMPP `htdocs/` folder (or `www/` for MAMP). 
   *(Make sure the folder is named exactly: `Online-Library-Management-System--OLMS-`)*
3. **Start** both Apache and MySQL from your XAMPP Control Panel.
4. **Open** `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in your web browser.
5. **Import the Database:** Go to the "Import" tab and upload the `database/olms.sql` file. 
   *(Note: You do not need to create a database first! The script will automatically build the `olms` database and insert the default Admin account).*
6. **Run the App:** Open `http://localhost/Online-Library-Management-System--OLMS-/` in your browser.

## 🤝 Team Workflow (Fork & Pull)
1. **Fork** this main repository to your personal GitHub account.
2. Clone your personal fork to your computer.
3. Write your code and test it locally.
4. Push the changes to your personal fork.
5. Submit a **Pull Request (PR)** to this main repository.

## Page Template
Copy and paste this into the top and bottom of your PHP files.

Note on Paths: If your file is inside a folder (like auth/login.php), you must use ../ to find the includes folder. If your file is in the main root (like index.php), you do not need the ../.

For files inside folders (auth/, core/, catalog/, admin/, operations/):

```text
<?php 
// 1. Include the header (This handles DB connection, Session, Navbar and CSS)
include '../includes/header.php'; 
?>

<div class="card p-4 shadow-sm">
    <h2>Page Title</h2>
    <p>Start building your feature here!</p>
</div>

<?php 
// 2. Include the footer (This handles JavaScript and closes tags)
include '../includes/footer.php'; 
?>
```

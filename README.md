### 🚀 Setup Instructions

1. **Install** XAMPP (or MAMP) on your computer.
2. **Clone the repository** directly into your XAMPP `htdocs/` folder (or `www/` for MAMP). 
   *(Make sure the folder is named exactly: `Online-Library-Management-System--OLMS-`)*
3. **Start** both Apache and MySQL from your XAMPP Control Panel.
4. **Open** `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in your web browser.
5. **Import the Database:** Go to the "Import" tab and upload the `database/olms.sql` file. 
   *(Note: You do not need to create a database first! The script will automatically build the `olms` database and insert the default Admin account).*
6. **Run the App:** Open `http://localhost/Online-Library-Management-System--OLMS-/` in your browser.

### 📌 Notes
